Create `session-{timestamp}-{slug}.md` with a complete summary of our session. You MUST store this in `.ai-sessions`. If the directory doesn't exist, create it with `mkdir -p .ai-sessions`. To generate the timestamp, you MUST ALWAYS use the following Unix command `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M`

In this report you should ALWAYS include the following:

- A brief recap of key actions.
- The main prompts and commands of the session.
- Total cost of the session.
- Efficiency insights.
- Possible process improvements.
- The total number of conversation turns.
- Any other interesting observations or highlights.
