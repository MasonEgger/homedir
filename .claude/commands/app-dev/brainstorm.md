# Brainstorm Command

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer who will implement using good TDD practices.

Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

## Critical Focus Areas

**TDD Implementation Ready**: Ensure the spec includes requirements for YOUR application logic that can be converted into failing tests first. Focus on business rules, data validation, error handling, and custom algorithms that YOU will implement - not framework or library behavior. Think about what application-specific behaviors need verification.

**Component Boundaries**: Identify clear, testable components that can be implemented independently and then integrated together. Each component should have well-defined inputs, outputs, and responsibilities.

**Global Claude Config Integration**: Follow the established development patterns and preferences from the user's global Claude configuration (found in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and related files). Respect their preferred tools, coding standards, and project structure approaches.

Focus on getting the technical details and component boundaries clear enough that the resulting spec can be broken down into implementable, testable steps that follow the user's established development workflow.

The goal of this is NOT to implement the application or write a bunch of code, but to create a specification file that you will use later to create a plan. I will review this after and make manual changes. You may write _some_ code to illustrate specific points, but do not focus on that. Instead focus on making the specification usable for you to consume and plan with later. 

Once we are done, save the spec as @spec.md

Here's the idea:
