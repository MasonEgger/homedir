# Brainstorm Command

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer who will implement using good TDD practices.

Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

## Critical Focus Areas

**TDD Implementation Ready**: Ensure the spec includes requirements that can be easily converted into failing tests first, then minimal implementations. Think about what would make good test scenarios.

**Component Boundaries**: Identify clear, testable components that can be implemented independently and then integrated together. Each component should have well-defined inputs, outputs, and responsibilities.

**Global Claude Config Integration**: Follow the established development patterns and preferences from the user's global Claude configuration (found in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and related files). Respect their preferred tools, coding standards, and project structure approaches.

Focus on getting the technical details and component boundaries clear enough that the resulting spec can be broken down into implementable, testable steps that follow the user's established development workflow.

Once we are done, save the spec as @spec.md

Here's the idea:
