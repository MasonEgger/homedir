# Sales Discovery Evaluation

Evaluate sales discovery calls to identify the 1-3 HIGHEST LEVERAGE changes for improving discovery effectiveness.

## Core Evaluation Goal

Provide **brutally concise**, **specific**, and **actionable** feedback. Focus on TOP 3 issues only. Target output: 1-2 pages maximum.

## Before Starting

1. **Request the call content** if not provided (transcript, recording, or notes)
2. **Identify context** in 2-3 bullets:
   - Call type & participants (AE/SA/both, customer roles)
   - Customer segment (self-hosted/legacy/modernization/cloud-native)
   - Evaluation mode (SA review / AE review / AE prep for SA / team collaboration)

## Role Responsibilities

**AE:** Business context, stakeholder mapping, quantify impact, create urgency, tee up SA
**SA:** Technical feasibility, connect tech to business impact, identify risks, demonstrate fit  
**Collaborative:** AE leads business, SA leads technical, both bridge to business impact

## Pain Level Framework

Use this to assess discovery depth:

- **1st level:** Technical symptoms (rigid workflows, slow changes, poor visibility)
- **2nd level:** Operational impact (engineering time, QA cycles, deployment friction)  
- **3rd level:** Business impact (revenue risk, competitive disadvantage, strategic blockers)

## Temporal Bridging

Connect current pain to business impact:

- **Self-hosted** → DevOps cost, opportunity cost, velocity
- **Legacy workflows** → Time-to-market, customer experience, competitive gap
- **Modernization** → Strategic initiatives blocked, revenue at risk

## Evaluation Output Structure

Follow this exact format. Keep each section minimal - use bullets over paragraphs.

### 1. PAIN DISCOVERY SNAPSHOT

```
Depth reached: [1st/2nd/3rd level]
Quality: [X/5]
Key miss: [One sentence on biggest missed opportunity]
```

### 2. QUESTION ANALYSIS

**Format:** `[Timestamp] [Who] Question → [Pain level] [Rating] → Missed bridge: [Exact better question]`

**Example:**
```
[5:48] [AE] "What's going wrong?" → 1st level, 4/5
→ Missed: "When changes take time, what does that cost? What gets delayed?"
```

**Summary line:**
```
Total questions: X (AE: X, SA: X) | Avg depth: X level | Follow-ups: X per topic
```

### 3. BUSINESS CONNECTION

One-line answers only:
- Connected tech → business? [Y/N + 1 example]
- Quantified pain? [Y/N + what metrics]
- Strategic implications? [Y/N + what uncovered]
- Who drove it? [AE/SA/Both/Neither]

### 4. COLLABORATION *(if AE + SA present)*

3 bullets max:
- Tag-team quality: [Effective/Passive/Duplicative]
- Best moment: [Timestamp + what happened]
- Missed handoff: [Timestamp + what should've happened]

### 5. KEY FINDINGS

**Keep doing (2-3 bullets max):**
- [Timestamp] [What worked] → [Why replicate]

**Fix immediately (Top 3 only - use FORK IN ROAD format):**
```
[Timestamp] Customer: "We're seeing limitations"
→ They said: [Moved to next topic]
→ Should've asked: "Tell me about those limitations. What's breaking? What can't you do?"
→ Would've uncovered: [Business impact]
```

**Pattern:** [One sentence on what they consistently do well/poorly]

### 6. AE PREP QUALITY *(if evaluating AE call before SA engagement)*

**Readiness score: X/7**

Checklist (Y/N only):
- [ ] Clear use case
- [ ] Business impact (not just symptoms)
- [ ] Scale/volume metrics
- [ ] Current architecture
- [ ] Timeline
- [ ] Technical stakeholders
- [ ] Key concerns documented

**Brief SA on:** [3 bullet points max]
**Still need:** [2 bullets on gaps]

### 7. COACHING PRIORITY

**Fix first:**
- Current: [One sentence]
- New: [One sentence]  
- Practice: [One sentence]

**Fix second:** [Same format]

**Long-term:** [Same format]

**Stop at 3 priorities.**

### 8. BENCHMARKS

One-line scores:
- Discovery %: X% (target: 40-50%)
- Follow-up depth: X (target: 2-3)
- Business metrics: X (target: 3-5)
- Pain level: X (target: 3rd level)

**Performance:** [Above/At/Below + one-sentence gap]

### 9. SUCCESS INDICATORS

**Score: X/7 present**
- [ ] Quantified impact
- [ ] Emotional language
- [ ] Urgency/timeline
- [ ] Multiple stakeholders
- [ ] Competitive implications
- [ ] Status quo costs
- [ ] Risk language

**Red flags: X present** (list only if present)

### 10. TALK TRACKS

Provide 3 max - exact format:
```
When customer says: "Workflows are rigid"
→ Instead of: [Moving to demo]
→ Ask: "When workflows can't adapt, what business impact do you see? What opportunities do you miss?"
```

### 11. NEXT CALL PREP *(if applicable)*

Brief for next call (5 bullets max):
- [Key context item]
- [Priority question]
- [Stakeholder to ask about]
- [Technical area to explore]
- [Business metric to quantify]

### 12. SUMMARY

```
Role: [AE/SA/Both]
Score: X/5
Strength: [One sentence]
Critical gap: [One sentence]
Fix first: [One sentence]
Ready for next call: [Y/N + what's missing]
```

## Critical Reminders

- **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE** - Keep your evaluation short
- **Be brutally concise** - No fluff, no repetition
- **Specific over generic** - Exact timestamps, exact quotes, exact alternative questions
- **Prioritized over comprehensive** - Top 3 issues only
- **Actionable over analytical** - What to do differently, not just what happened
- **Maximum 2-3 examples per section** (not 5-7)
- **One-sentence explanations** (not three sentences)
- **Skip sections that don't apply**
- **Target length: 1-2 pages max**

The shorter and more focused your feedback, the more likely it gets acted on.
