# BPE Plugin

Brainstorm-Plan-Execute development workflow with session tracking and lessons learned.

## Overview

This plugin packages the BPE loop - a structured workflow for building software with Claude Code using test-driven development. It also includes session management for tracking work history and accumulating lessons across sessions.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/bpe:brainstorm` | Iterative Q&A to develop a project specification (`spec.md`) |
| `/bpe:plan` | Transform spec into implementation roadmap (`plan.md` + `todo.md`) |
| `/bpe:execute-plan` | Implement one step at a time following strict TDD |
| `/bpe:session-summary` | Generate session recap and capture lessons learned |
| `/bpe:lessons` | View, search, and manage accumulated lessons |

## The BPE Loop

1. **Brainstorm** - Develop a thorough specification through iterative dialogue
2. **Plan** - Break the spec into right-sized, TDD-structured implementation steps
3. **Execute** - Implement steps one at a time, following the plan exactly
4. **Review & Record** - Summarize the session and capture lessons for next time

## Session Management

Session artifacts live in `.ai-sessions/` at the project root:

- **Session summaries** - Individual markdown files capturing what happened each session
- **lessons.md** - Accumulated cross-session learnings in a hybrid format (recent + categorized)

The execute-plan command automatically reads the most recent session summary for continuity.

## Installation

This plugin is deployed via the homedir Ansible playbook. It lives at `.claude/plugins/bpe/` in the homedir repository.
